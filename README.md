## Data Structure in C - Type of Sorting

## Technologies Used
- Only an IDE can run C/C++. I run it in the GDB Compiler.

## How I execute?
You need to clone this repository to your PC or simply copy the code.

## How do I compile this codes on my PC?
- Open this repository and clone the files or copy the code.
- Use any online compiler or DEV C++, which is free.

## Explain Type of Sorting

## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region, and moves it to the end of the sorted region.

## Quick Sort
Quick Sort uses a divide-and-conquer approach, selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array into two sub-arrays according to whether the elements are less than or greater than the pivot, then recursively sorting the sub-arrays.

## Merge Sort
Merge Sort also uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, recursively dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time, taking each element from the input and inserting it into the correct position in the already sorted part of the array.
